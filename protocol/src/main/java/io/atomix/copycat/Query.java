/**
 * Base interface for operations that read system state.
 * <p>
 * Queries are submitted by clients to a Raft server to read Raft cluster-wide state. In contrast to
 * {@link Command commands}, queries allow for more flexible {@link ConsistencyLevel consistency levels} that trade
 * consistency for performance.
 * <h2>Consistency levels</h2>
 * All queries must specify a {@link #consistency()} with which to execute the query. The provided consistency level
 * dictates how queries are submitted to the Raft cluster. When a query is submitted to the cluster, the query is
 * sent in a message to the server to which the client is currently connected. The server handles the query requests
 * based on the configured {@link Query.ConsistencyLevel}. For {@link ConsistencyLevel#SEQUENTIAL} consistency, followers
 * are allowed to execute queries with certain constraints for faster reads. For higher consistency levels like
 * {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE} and {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE_LEASE}, queries are forwarded to the
 * cluster leader. See the {@link Query.ConsistencyLevel} documentation for more info.
 * <p>
 * By default, all queries should use the strongest consistency level, {@link ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE}.
 * It is essential that users understand the trade-offs in the various consistency levels before using them.
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 * Queries must be serializable both by the client and by all servers in the cluster. By default, all operations use
 * Java serialization. However, default serialization in slow because it requires the full class name and does not allocate
 * memory efficiently. For this reason, it's recommended that commands implement {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable}
 * or register a custom {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.TypeSerializer} for better performance. Serializable types
 * can be registered on the associated client/serzver {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer} instance.
