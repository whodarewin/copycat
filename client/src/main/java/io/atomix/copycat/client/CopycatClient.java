/**
 * Provides an interface for submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query} queries to the Copycat cluster.
 * <p>
 * Copycat clients are responsible for connecting to the cluster and submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries}
 * that operate on the cluster's replicated state machine. Copycat clients interact with one or more nodes in a Copycat cluster
 * through a session. When the client is {@link #connect() connected}, the client will attempt to communicate with one of the known member
 * {@link Address} provided to the builder. As long as the client can communicate with at least one correct member of the
 * cluster, it can register a session. Once the client is able to register a {@link Session}, it will receive an updated list
 * of members for the entire cluster and thereafter be allowed to communicate with all servers.
 * <p>
 * Sessions are created by registering the client through the cluster leader. Clients always connect to a single node in the
 * cluster, and in the event of a node failure or partition, the client will detect the failure and reconnect to a correct server.
 * <p>
 * Clients periodically send <em>keep-alive</em> requests to the server to which they're connected. The keep-alive request
 * interval is determined by the cluster's session timeout, and the session timeout is determined by the leader's configuration
 * at the time that the session is registered. This ensures that clients cannot be misconfigured with a keep-alive interval
 * greater than the cluster's session timeout.
 * <p>
 * Clients communicate with the distributed state machine by submitting {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} to
 * the cluster through the {@link #submit(Command)} and {@link #submit(Query)} methods respectively:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.submit(new PutCommand("foo", "Hello world!")).thenAccept(result -> {
 *     System.out.println("Result is " + result);
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * All client methods are fully asynchronous and return {@link CompletableFuture}. To block until a method is complete, use
 * the {@link CompletableFuture#get()} or {@link CompletableFuture#join()} methods.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Sessions</h3>
 * <p>
 * Sessions work to provide linearizable semantics for client {@link Command commands}. When a command is submitted to the cluster,
 * the command will be forwarded to the leader where it will be logged and replicated. Once the command is stored on a majority
 * of servers, the leader will apply it to its state machine and respond.
 * <p>
 * Sessions also allow {@link Query queries} (read-only requests) submitted by the client to optionally be executed on follower
 * nodes. When a query is submitted to the cluster, the query's {@link Query#consistency()} will be used to determine how the
 * query is handled. For queries with stronger consistency levels, they will be forwarded to the cluster's leader. For weaker
 * consistency queries, they may be executed on follower nodes according to the consistency level constraints. See the
 * {@link Query.ConsistencyLevel} documentation for more info.
 * <p>
 * Throughout the lifetime of a client, the client may operate on the cluster via multiple sessions according to the configured
 * {@link RecoveryStrategy}. In the event that the client's session expires, the client may register a new session and continue
 * to submit operations under the recovered session. The client will always attempt to ensure commands submitted are eventually
 * committed to the cluster even across sessions. If a command is submitted under one session but is not completed before the
 * session is lost and a new session is established, the client will resubmit pending commands from the prior session under
 * the new session. This, though, may break linearizability guarantees since linearizability is only guaranteed within the context
 * if a session.
 * <p>
 * Users should watch the client for {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.CopycatClient.State state} changes to determine when
 * linearizability guarantees may be broken.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.onStateChange(state -> {
 *     if (state == CopycatClient.State.SUSPENDED) {
 *
 *     }
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The most notable client state is the {@link CopycatClient.State#SUSPENDED SUSPENDED} state. This state indicates that
 * the client cannot communicate with the cluster and consistency guarantees <em>may</em> have been broken. While in this
 * state, the client's session from the perspective of servers may timeout, the {@link Session} events sent to the client
 * by the cluster may be lost.
 * <h3>Session events</h3>
 * Clients can receive arbitrary event notifications from the cluster by registering an event listener via
 * {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer)}. When a command is applied to a state machine, the state machine may publish any number
 * of events to any open session. Events will be sent to the client by the server to which the client is connected as dictated
 * by the configured {@link ServerSelectionStrategy}. In the event a client is disconnected from a server, events will be
 * retained in memory on all servers until the client reconnects to another server or its session expires. Once a client
 * reconnects to a new server, the new server will resume sending session events to the client.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.<ChangeEvent>onEvent("change", change -> {
 *     System.out.println("value changed from " + change.oldValue() + " to " + change.newValue());
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Session consistency</h3>
 * Sessions guarantee linearizability for all <em>commands</em> submitted by the client within the context of a session.
 * This means when the client submits a command, the command is guaranteed to be applied to the replicated state machine
 * between invocation and response. Furthermore, concurrent operations from a single client are guaranteed to be applied
 * in FIFO order even when switching between writes to the leader and reads from followers. In the event that a session
 * is expired by the cluster, linearizability guarantees are lost. It's possible for a command to be applied to the cluster
 * without a successful response if the client's session expires.
 * <p>
 * Clients guarantee that all operations submitted to the cluster will be applied in sequential order and responses will
 * be received by the client in sequential order. This means the {@link CompletableFuture}s returned when submitting
 * operations through the client are guaranteed to be completed in the order in which they were created.
 * <p>
 * Sequential consistency is also guaranteed for {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer) events} received by a client, and events
 * are sequenced with command and query responses. If a client submits a command that publishes an event and then immediately
 * submits a concurrent query, the client will first receive the command response, then the event message, then the query
 * response.
 * <p>
 * All events and responses are received in the client's event thread. Because all operation results are received on the same
 * thread, it is critical that clients not block the event thread. If clients need to perform blocking actions on response to
 * an event or response, do so on another thread.
 * <h3>Serialization</h3>
 * All {@link Command commands}, {@link Query queries}, and session {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer) events} must be
 * serializable by the {@link Serializer} associated with the client. Serializable types can be registered at any time.
 * To register a serializable type and serializer, use the {@link Serializer#register(Class) register} methods.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.serializer().register(SetCommand.class, new SetCommandSerializer());
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * By default, all primitives and many collections are supported. Catalyst also provides support for common serialization
 * frameworks like Kryo and Jackson:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   client.serializer().register(SetCommand.class, new GenericKryoSerializer());
 *   }
 * </pre>
