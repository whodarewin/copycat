/**
 * Provides a standalone implementation of the <a href="http://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus algorithm</a>.
 * <p>
 * To create a new server, use the server {@link CopycatServer.Builder}. Servers require
 * cluster membership information in order to perform communication. Each server must be provided a local {@link Address}
 * to which to bind the internal {@link io.atomix.catalyst.transport.Server} and a set of addresses for other members in
 * the cluster.
 * <h2>State machines</h2>
 * Underlying each server is a {@link StateMachine}. The state machine is responsible for maintaining the state with
 * relation to {@link Command}s and {@link Query}s submitted to the server by a client. State machines are provided
 * in a factory to allow servers to transition between stateful and stateless states.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   Address address = new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000);
 *   Collection<Address> members = Arrays.asList(new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000), new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000));
 *
 *   CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address)
 *     .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Server state machines are responsible for registering {@link Command}s which can be submitted to the cluster. Raft
 * relies upon determinism to ensure consistency throughout the cluster, so <em>it is imperative that each server in
 * a cluster have the same state machine with the same commands.</em> State machines are provided to the server as
 * a {@link Supplier factory} to allow servers to {@link Member#promote(Member.Type) transition} between stateful
 * and stateless states.
 * <h2>Transports</h2>
 * By default, the server will use the {@code NettyTransport} for communication. You can configure the transport via
 * {@link CopycatServer.Builder#withTransport(Transport)}. To use the Netty transport, ensure you have the
 * {@code io.atomix.catalyst:catalyst-netty} jar on your classpath.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address)
 *   .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *   .withTransport(NettyTransport.builder()
 *     .withThreads(4)
 *     .build())
 *   .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Storage</h2>
 * As {@link Command}s are received by the server, they're written to the Raft {@link Log} and replicated to other members
 * of the cluster. By default, the log is stored on disk, but users can override the default {@link Storage} configuration
 * via {@link CopycatServer.Builder#withStorage(Storage)}. Most notably, to configure the storage module to store entries in
 * memory instead of disk, configure the {@link StorageLevel}.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address)
 *   .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *   .withStorage(Storage.builder()
 *     .withDirectory(new File("logs"))
 *     .withStorageLevel(StorageLevel.DISK)
 *     .build())
 *   .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Servers use the {@code Storage} object to manage the storage of cluster configurations, voting information, and
 * state machine snapshots in addition to logs. See the {@link Storage} documentation for more information.
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 * All serialization is performed with a Catalyst {@link Serializer}. The serializer is shared across all components of
 * the server. Users are responsible for ensuring that {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} submitted to the
 * cluster can be serialized by the server serializer by registering serializable types as necessary.
 * <p>
 * By default, the server serializer does not allow arbitrary classes to be serialized due to security concerns. However,
 * users can enable arbitrary class serialization by disabling the {@link Serializer#disableWhitelist() whitelisting feature}
 * on the Catalyst {@link Serializer}:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   server.serializer().disableWhitelist();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * However, for more efficient serialization, users should explicitly register serializable classes and binary
 * {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.TypeSerializer serializers}. Explicit registration of serializable types allows
 * types to be serialized using more compact 8- 16- 24- and 32-bit serialization IDs rather than serializing complete
 * class names. Thus, serializable type registration is strongly recommended for production systems.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   server.serializer().register(MySerializable.class, 123, MySerializableSerializer.class);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Bootstrapping the cluster</h2>
 * Once a server has been built, it must either be {@link #bootstrap() bootstrapped} to form a new cluster or
 * {@link #join(Address...) joined} to an existing cluster. The simplest way to bootstrap a new cluster is to bootstrap
 * a single server to which additional servers can be joined.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   CompletableFuture<CopycatServer> future = server.bootstrap();
 *   future.thenRun(() -> {
 *     System.out.println("Server bootstrapped!");
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, the bootstrapped cluster can include multiple servers by providing an initial configuration to the
 * {@link #bootstrap(Address...)} method on each server. When bootstrapping a multi-node cluster, the bootstrap configuration
 * must be identical on all servers for safety.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     List<Address> cluster = Arrays.asList(
 *       new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000)
 *     );
 *
 *     CompletableFuture<CopycatServer> future = server.bootstrap(cluster);
 *     future.thenRun(() -> {
 *       System.out.println("Cluster bootstrapped");
 *     });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Adding a server to an existing cluster</h2>
 * Once a single- or multi-node cluster has been {@link #bootstrap() bootstrapped}, often times users need to
 * add additional servers to the cluster. For example, some users prefer to bootstrap a single-node cluster and
 * add additional nodes to that server. Servers can join existing bootstrapped clusters using the {@link #join(Address...)}
 * method. When joining an existing cluster, the server simply needs to specify at least one reachable server in the
 * existing cluster.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(new Address("123.456.789.3", 5000))
 *       .withTransport(NettyTransport.builder().withThreads(4).build())
 *       .build();
 *
 *     List<Address> cluster = Arrays.asList(
 *       new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000)
 *     );
 *
 *     CompletableFuture<CopycatServer> future = server.join(cluster);
 *     future.thenRun(() -> {
 *       System.out.println("Server joined successfully!");
 *     });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Server types</h2>
 * Servers form new clusters and join existing clusters as active Raft voting members by default. However, for
 * large deployments Copycat also supports alternative types of nodes which are configured by setting the server
 * {@link Member.Type}. For example, the {@link Member.Type#PASSIVE PASSIVE} server type does not participate
 * directly in the Raft consensus algorithm and instead receives state changes via an asynchronous gossip protocol.
 * This allows passive members to scale sequential reads beyond the typical three- or five-node Raft cluster. The
 * {@link Member.Type#RESERVE RESERVE} server type is a stateless server that can act as a standby to the stateful
 * servers in the cluster, being {@link Member#promote(Member.Type) promoted} to a stateful state when necessary.
 * <p>
 * Server types are defined in the server builder simply by passing the initial {@link Member.Type} to the
 * {@link Builder#withType(Member.Type)} setter:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   CopycatServer server = CopycatServer.builder(address)
 *     .withType(Member.Type.PASSIVE)
 *     .withTransport(new NettyTransport())
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>

   * servers are configured with the {@code io.atomix.catalyst.transport.netty.NettyTransport} transport if it's available on
   * the classpath. Users should provide a {@link Storage} instance to specify how the server stores state changes.
